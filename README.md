# Introduction to Python at Windsor High School

<p> Welcome to Introduction to Python.  If you are reading this, you are probably a student at Windsor High School.  If not, feel free to read over the materials here, fork and/or download them if you would like and suggest edits.  These materials are meant to be used free of charge for educational purposes.</p>
<p> The best way to learn how to use Python as a tool for designing programs is to keep the following in mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Learning to program is much like learning a new language - it takes lots of practice!</li>
  <li>Most of your time spent in this course will be fixing errors in your code.</li>
  <li>Anyone can learn a programming language.  While it comes easier to some, through persistence, we can all do it.</li>
  <li>Learning Python can be a fun journey if you are willing to work to learn!</li>
</ol>

<p><i>"They say that no plan survives first contact with implementation.  I tend to agree."</i> -- Mark Watney, Sol 41</p>

<p> <b>Remember that programmers spend a majority of their time debugging code.  You will too.  It is not because this course is made too hard for you...it is just the way programming works.</b></p>
